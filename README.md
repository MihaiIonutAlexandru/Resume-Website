# Resume-Website
Excited to share my project â€“ Resume Website! As a Software Tester, I want to showcase my skills in creating a website that is not just any site but one that serves a purpose for me. In this project, I will apply my basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, with some use of JavaScript in certain areas.

The structure of the website is based on what I learned in a 7-day marathon course on HTML + CSS organized by GoIT, which strongly influenced me in creating this project.
